Hello! my name is Radek and Im from poland.
I live in Warsaw and study in Military University of Technology.
Im a student of Computer Science on the fourth semester of study.
This is some text which I will encrypt and then decrypt with a frequency of appearances.
I will do it by a monoalphabetic cipher.
Monoalphabetic cipher is a method of encrypting text with usage of arrangement of letters in a alphabet.
When you want to encrypt a character you have to convert that letter to letter that is given steps further in alphabet.
You have to note the fact that the changes goes as a cycle.
